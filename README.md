Columbia Basin Resistance Portal locations for maxfield 

The purpose is to help keep track of portal locations for "maxfiled" plans.
i.e.  http://www.ingress-maxfield.com/index.php 
for the python people out there: https://github.com/jpeterbaker/maxfield 

The format of the files is so that you can directly upload them to the maxfield
site or use the python tool directly.

Portal name; intel link; (optional) number of keys

If you know how many keys you have, you can update this number before you use 
the tool, and the tool will help you understand how many keys you need.
